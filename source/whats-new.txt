.. _kafka-connector-whats-new-1.13:

What's New in 1.13
------------------

- Added a custom authentication provider interface for Source and Sink
  Connectors. This feature enables you to write and use a custom implementation
  class in your connector. To learn more, see the :ref:`kafka-custom-auth` guide.

- Fixed an issue that occurred when validating configuration for Source
  and Sink Connectors if the configuration contained secrets and used
  the ``Provider`` framework. To learn more about this fix, see the
  `KAFKA-414 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/KAFKA-414>`__ JIRA issue.

.. _kafka-connector-whats-new-1.12:

What's New in 1.12
------------------

- Added support for a ``data`` configuration value in the ``mongo.errors.tolerance``
  configuration setting. With ``mongo.errors.tolerance=data``, the sink
  connector tolerates only data errors, and fails for any others.

.. _kafka-connector-whats-new-1.11.2:

What's New in 1.11.2
--------------------

- Fixed a bug in which unsuccessful attempts to retrieve items from a change stream were logged
  at the ``INFO`` level instead of at ``ERROR`` level. To learn more about this fix, see the
  `KAFKA-396 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/KAFKA-396>`__ JIRA issue.

- Fixed a bug in which requirements for the ``DELETE_WRITEMODEL_STRATEGY_CONFIG`` String value
  prevented the creation of a ``DeleteOneDefaultStrategy`` object. To learn more
  about this fix, see the `KAFKA-395 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/KAFKA-395>`__
  JIRA issue.

.. _kafka-connector-whats-new-1.11.1:

What's New in 1.11.1
--------------------

- Fixed wildcard matching on partial field names in documents. To learn more
  about this fix, see the `KAFKA-391 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/KAFKA-391>`__
  JIRA issue.

- Fixed an issue in which a null pointer exception is thrown when the
  connector attempts to log null values on configuration settings. To learn
  more about this fix, see the `KAFKA-390 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/KAFKA-390>`__
  JIRA issue.
